## splinebruty

A quick and dirty tool that bruteforces and goes to every possible spline on a map in SSX Tricky.

## Building

Tested only on Windows.

Open a VS 2019 dev command prompt, cd to where you cloned and run "build"
this will make "main.exe" (too lazy to dick with cl arguments, sorry)

A proper build system would have taken too much time for a 5 minute prototyping project

## Usage

Run main.exe with the path to a PBD file. 

You'll need PCSX2 with PINE enabled.
